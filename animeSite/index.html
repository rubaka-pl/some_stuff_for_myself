                            new books, and snowball fights on the frozen battlefield.</p>

                        <p>Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have
                            sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a
                            change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the
                            greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the
                            Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited
                            amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the
                            Pirate King.</p>
